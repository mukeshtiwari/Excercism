# Phone Number

Write a program that cleans up user-entered phone numbers so that they can be sent SMS messages.

The rules are as follows:

- If the phone number is less than 10 digits assume that it is bad
  number
- If the phone number is 10 digits assume that it is good
- If the phone number is 11 digits and the first number is 1, trim the 1
  and use the last 10 digits
- If the phone number is 11 digits and the first number is not 1, then
  it is a bad number
- If the phone number is more than 11 digits assume that it is a bad
  number

We've provided tests, now make them pass.

Hint: Only make one test pass at a time. Disable the others, then flip
each on in turn after you get the current failing one to pass.

For running the tests provided, you will need `Opam` and `Core`. Consult [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org) website for instuctions on how to install for your OS. Once `opam` is installed open a terminal window and run the following command to install core:

opam install core

## Running Tests

Because OCaml is a compiled language you need to compile your submission and the test code before you can run the tests. Compile with

```bash
$ corebuild -quiet test.native
```

and when successful run the tests by running the `test.native` executable:

```bash
./test.native
```

Alternatively just type

```bash
make
```
